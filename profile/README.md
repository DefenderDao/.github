# Defender DAO
A DAO tool for the web3 ecosystem that enables decentralized secure wallet-to-wallet communication

## How it works:
DAO community allows entry submission. Then votes will be provided and scammers that are identified will be put into a bucket and blacklisted. This bucket contains the url, wallet id that caught scammer, and date submitted.
